A modular colorimetry library for Ruby, decomposed into focused, composable gems.

## Project Status

üöß **Under Active Development** - This project is currently being decomposed from a monolithic gem into smaller,
focused components.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Temporary Repository Structure** - This monorepo structure is temporary for development convenience. Upon release,
individual gems will be moved to separate repositories and included as git submodules.

## Prerequisites

* [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) *(optional)* - Tool version management and task runner
* Ruby 3.2+

## Goals

* **Modularity** - Break down monolith into focused components
* **Composability** - Mix and match only the colorimetry features you need
* **Extensibility** - Clean plugin system for adding new capabilities
* **Performance** - Event-driven architecture with lazy loading

## Contributing

This project is in active decomposition. Please coordinate with maintainers before contributing to avoid conflicts with
